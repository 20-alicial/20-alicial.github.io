## Ongoing Research
1. How does neural event segmentation rate vary with age and clinical symptoms when viewing naturalistic stimuli, and what are the best algorithms to estimate this? (advised by YC Leong)
2. How can we build graph-based representations of biases and stereotypes in commercial LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) and use such representations for de-biasing? (advised by Xuechunzi Bai)
