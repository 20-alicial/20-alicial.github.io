More papers to come (stay tuned)!

## Talks & Presentations
* “Individual Differences in Neural Event Segmentation of Continuous Experience”
Presented at Institute for Mind & Biology, UChicago, 2024.
Discussed the paper by Clara Sava-Segal, Chandler Richards, Megan Leung, and Emily S. Finn, with my current projects related to the topic.

## Ongoing Research
1. How does neural event segmentation rate vary with age and clinical symptoms when viewing naturalistic stimuli, and what are the best algorithms to estimate this? (advised by YC Leong)
2. How can we build graph-based representations of biases and stereotypes in commercial LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT) and use such representations for de-biasing? (advised by Xuechunzi Bai)
