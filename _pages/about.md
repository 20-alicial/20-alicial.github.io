Hello! I'm Alicia, a Master's student in the [Computational Affective and Social Neuroscience Laboratory](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/), advised by Yuan Chang Leong. I also work with Xuechunzi Bai on bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) and how LLMs can reduce stereotype bias in humans.

I'm interested in how people build structured expectations (mental models or priors) of the world from experience, how these models are selectively activated during naturalistic information processing, and how inaccurate models can be updated through new experience. I use brain imaging and computational modelling to study these questions. 

I obtained my B.S in Computer Science and B.A in Philosophy from the University of Chicago in 2024.
