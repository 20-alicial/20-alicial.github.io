Hello! I'm Alicia, a full-time research assistant and joint lab manager for Yuan Chang Leong and Xuechunzi Bai at the University of Chicago. 

I'm interested in how people build structured expectations and models of the world from experience, how these models & memories are selectively and idiosyncratically activated when processing new information, and how harmful models can be updated through new experiences. I use naturalistic brain imaging (fMRI), behaviorial tasks & eye-tracking, LLMs, and computational modelling to study these questions.
