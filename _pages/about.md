Hello! I'm Alicia, a Master's student in the [Computational Affective and Social Neuroscience Laboratory](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/), advised by Yuan Chang Leong. Broadly speaking, I'm interested in understanding cognition and social behavior through neurocomputational modeling. Currently, most of my work is on motivation and episodic memory.

I obtained my B.S in Computer Science (Specialization in Machine Learning) and B.A in Philosophy from the University of Chicago in 2024.
