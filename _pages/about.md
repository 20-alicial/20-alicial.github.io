Hello! I'm Alicia, a Master's student in the [Computational Affective and Social Neuroscience Laboratory](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/), advised by Yuan Chang Leong. I also work with Xuechunzi Bai on graph-based representations of bias in Langauges Languages Models (LLMs). 

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in understanding memory, learning, and decision making through neurocomputational modeling, especially in areas overlapping with mental health & interactions with AI. Currently, most of my work is on motivation and episodic memory.

I obtained my B.S in Computer Science (Specialization in Machine Learning) and B.A in Philosophy from the University of Chicago in 2024.

Fun fact: I am number 9 in the world on an online game called [Letter Speed](https://openquant.co/math-game) from OpenQuant (as of Oct 2024).
