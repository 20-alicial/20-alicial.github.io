Hello! I'm Alicia, a Master's student in the [Computational Affective and Social Neuroscience Laboratory](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/), advised by Yuan Chang Leong. I also work with Xuechunzi Bai on bias in Large Language Models.

I'm interested in how people build structured expectations (mental models or priors) of the world from experience, how these models are selectively activated during naturalistic information processing, and how inaccurate models can be updated through new experience.

I obtained my B.S in Computer Science and B.A in Philosophy from the University of Chicago in 2024.

Fun fact: I am number 9 in the world on an online game called [Letter Speed](https://openquant.co/math-game) from OpenQuant (as of Oct 2024).
